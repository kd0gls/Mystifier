# Mystifier

This is a modern remake of the Eicocraft EC-700 Electronic Mystifier. The EC-700 was a hobbyist kit available in the mid-1960s. It had six neon lamps that blinked one at a time in a seemingly random fashion. The circuit had six cross-coupled RC relaxation oscillators and was powered by a 90-volt B battery commonly used in portable tube radios. This project is the fourth in a series of remakes designed to recreate the experience of the original, but using modern circuitry and readily available parts.
